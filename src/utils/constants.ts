export const INTRO_PHRASE = `A full-stack engineer, trying to find a place in the world of instructions and logic; driven by this one simple philosophy — a few lines of code, simplest version of an idea, and the ability to make something off it, and you can make a dent in the universe. Based out of India, I am passionate about solving problems that makes the world more simple and memorable to experience. I strive to make each and every part of the system seamless and a joy to use — whether its the shining armour on the outside or the numerous nuts and bolts keeping it together underneath. To sum up — a guy with the mind of an engineer, heart of an artist.`;
